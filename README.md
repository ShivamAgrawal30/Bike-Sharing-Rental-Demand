# Bike-Sharing-Rental-Demand

### Context-
- In this project, we were asked to combine historical usage patterns with weather data in order to forecast bike rental demand in the Capital Bikeshare program in Washington, D.C. The data is for the years of 2011 and 2012. This dataset was provided by Hadi Fanaee Tork using data from Capital Bikeshare.

### Files-
- "bike_sharing_demand.ipynb" -> contains the data exploration, feature engineering, and data modelling part.
- "BikeRental.csv" -> our dataset

### Conclusion-
- For our usecase we observe that the Random Forest Regression Model was the better model to predict the ‘count of bikes’ rented during each hour based on historical usage patterns with weather data.
